This code was written in a Python 3.6 environment.

The only non-standard library utilized is the mmh3 (murmur hash) library, which can be installed using:

"pip install mmh3"

in the terminal/command prompt.

To run this code locally, please ensure that the corresponding data files are located in the same directory as the python script (data_mining_hw5_q3.py).
