To run my code, simply run the data_mining_hw4_q3.py script by any method of your choosing (whether that be through the command line or an IDE).

Please ensure that that karate.gml file is in the same location as the python script realtive to your machine.

You will need the following packages installed in your python environment:

time
warnings
numpy
networkx
sklearn

I ran it in a Python 3.6 environment, so I know it will at least work for this version of python, but I cannot guarentee for any other version. With that, all packages required are baseline except for networkx (which can be installed using "pip/conda install networkx" in the terminal/command prompt once you have activated your python environment.)

To see the output produced when ran on my machine, please refer to output.txt.
